## Course Description

This course, **narrated in Hindi/Urdu**, has been designed for complete beginners aspiring to learn front-end web development. The special thing about this course is going to be the practical roadmap that has been carefully designed to get anyone up and running with their web development journey as fast and efficiently as possible. You can find a lot of other HTML and CSS tutorials for beginners in Hindi/Urdu online. The main thing they lack is their ability to take the learner from the learning phase to practice in an efficient manner. Often the audience of these tutorials finds themselves wondering where and how to start their practical journey. This course is here to fill that gap. I'll teach you how to bring your skills together and make something productive.

This tutorial series can turn out to be beneficial for those people as well who are struggling to find a legitimate way to earn money online. Front-end web development is a practical cash-making skill that can reap benefits over the coming years if you are determined to dedicate some time to it.
